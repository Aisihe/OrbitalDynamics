Prior to entering this project, i needed to gain experience
constructing phase diagrams, animations, and with
Scipy's differential equation solver library. 
These playgrounds to build the skill for the full project
are housed in the TestingPlaygrounds folder.

This is a multi-step project. STEP1 chronicles the purely driven subcase.
Based on how far I am, the WIP folder will chronicle the purely damped
case and the combined driven-damped case. 

Auxdiagram.py contains a reference to an auxillary circle that contians the 
Keplerian orbit. It is utilized in my proof/derivation of Kepler's equations in Step1.py.

Quaternion.py contains the custom code required for the quaternion implementation. 

SpringPendulumAnimation.gif is the animation of the spring pendulum generated from 
Playground3-SpringPendulum.

Step1-ChaoticRotations is a Jupyter noteboox that contains the code for simulating
the driven orbits of a satellite about a perturbing body. It also documents the derivation
of Kepler's equations, as well as a pathway that explains motivating steps to make 
the proof easier to understand, and to elucidate the proof writing for more complicated derivations.
